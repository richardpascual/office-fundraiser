# office-fundraiser README doc #
The following document is the read-me for the office-fundraiser project.

## Introduction ##

Welcome to the office-fundraiser project. If you have a small, large or multiple fundraising projects managed through your office or organization, this tool may be of use to you. This application is designed for secured, internal intranet network environments so exercise appropriate caution when implementing this project on your own systems.

## Purpose ##

The purpose of this project is to allow employees or members of a office environment to come together and raise money for a common cause or multiple causes. The back-end database and PL/SQL API's accompanying this project are designed to making the programming of a web-based intranet front-end interface much easier. A front-end interface using Oracle APEX also accompanies this project if you do not have the time to make one of your own.

## Installation ##

The following is the packaging list of scripts which need to be run on your hosting workstation/server in order to run the application.

1. The SQL `schema` file should be compiled first.
1. The SQL `api and objects` file should be compiled second.
1. If you need the front end application, install the `APEX` script using the Apex application installer.
